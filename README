App that runs in Google App Engine. Test app as I'm learning python. (Java developer)

I was interested to see if choosing different dates for when to invest
makes much of a difference. This is for info only, and like they say, past
does not gaurantee will continue that way. Pretty basic right now,
can view data starting at a certain month for one or more stocks/mutual funds/etc.
If look at different windows, which days seem better is different.

The helper class could be used as a start for other apps needing historical 
ticker price data.
